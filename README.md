## What is Pear?

Pear is an MCP server that connects Claude Code to your iCloud account. Ask Claude to check your calendar, create events, manage reminders, look up contacts — all through natural language.

```
> "What's on my calendar today?"
> "Schedule a 45-minute meeting with Sarah this week"
> "Remind me to submit the report by Friday"
> "What's John's phone number?"
> "Find me 3 free slots for a 2-hour workshop next week"
```

Works on **macOS, Linux, and Windows** via CalDAV/CardDAV — no Apple hardware required.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get a Pear API Key

Sign up at **[pearmcp.com](https://pearmcp.com)**, connect your iCloud account, and generate an API key.

> You'll need an [Apple app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654) to connect your iCloud account.

### 2. Set Your API Key

```bash
export PEAR_API_KEY=pear_sk_your_key_here
```

### 3. Install

**Option A — Claude Plugin:**
```
/plugin marketplace add AshtonAU/pear-plugin
/plugin install pear@pear-marketplace
```

**Option B — MCP Server (direct):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http pear https://pearmcp.com/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $PEAR_API_KEY"
```

**Option C — OpenClaw Skill:**
```bash
clawhub install pear-apple
```

### 4. Verify

```
/pear:pear-setup
```

## How It Works

    │◀── MCP JSON-RPC ───────── │                            │
```

## Privacy & Security

| Concern | How Pear Handles It |
|---------|-------------------|
| iCloud credentials | Encrypted at rest, never shared with Claude |
| Calendar/contact data | Proxied in real-time, **not stored** on Pear servers |
| API authentication | Bearer token (`PEAR_API_KEY`) — Claude never sees your Apple ID |
| Data in transit | HTTPS/TLS everywhere |
